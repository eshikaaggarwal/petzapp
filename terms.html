              <p>Service Providers may agree to provide Pet Care Services to a Pet Owner by agreeing to a Booking. If you are a Service Provider, you must confirm the Booking before it expires or the Pet Care Owner will have no obligation to complete the transaction. </p>

              <p>Once the Booking is completed by both parties, you agree to honor the price set forth in your Booking. The purchase of Pet Care Services is a transaction between the Pet Owner and the Service Provider. </p>

              <p>Petzapp's role is to facilitate payments from Petzapp. Pet Owners to Service Providers as limited payment agents for the Service Provider. We collect payment from the Pet Owner at the time of Booking and (except to the extent of any payment hold) remit payment to the Service Provider's account on the Petzapp Service 24 hours after the pet has checked in with the Pet Service provider during the service period indicated in the Booking. </p>

              <p>Service Providers are charged a service fee. Which we deduct before remitting payment to Service Providers.</p>

              <li><b>Service fees</b></li>
              <p>We charge service fees for some aspects of the Petzapp Service. If you are a Service Provider, except where otherwise specified via the Petzapp Service, our service fee is calculated as a percentage of the fees a Pet Owner agrees to pay in a Booking. </p>

              <p>We deduct this service fee from the amounts paid by the Pet Owner.</p>


            </ul>

            <li>Cancellations and Refunds</li>

            <ul style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
              <li><b>Cancellations by Service Provider:-</b></li>
              <p>If a Service Provider cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period identified in the Booking, we will refund the fees paid by the Pet Owner for Pet Care Services not provided, as well as any service charge paid to Petzapp.</p>

              <p>Service Provider cancellations are taken seriously. If you are a Service Provider, you acknowledge that cancellation by you may result in a review of your account and, if we deem it appropriate, suspension or termination of your access to the Petzapp.in Service.</p>

              <li>Reservation Protection:-</li>

              <p>Petzapp uses all reasonable efforts to find replacement Service Providers when Service Providers cancel Bookings near the start date of the service period identified in the Booking. </p>

              <p>The availability of the Reservation Protection depends on the timing of the cancellation and the type of Pet Care Services provided.</p>

              <p>Generally, if a Pet Owner accepts a new Booking with a replacement Service Provider, Petzapp will (with the limited exceptions described below) pay the cost difference between the original Booking and the new Booking, up to but not exceeding 25% of the total cost of the original Booking. </p>

              <p>However, if a Booking is cancelled by a Service Provider due to the Pet Owner's failure to provide accurate or complete information regarding the pet or due to the pet's aggressive behavior, the Pet Owner is responsible for the full cost of any new reservation.</p>

              <li><b>Cancellations by Pet Owner:-</b></li>

              <p>If a Pet Owner cancels a Booking prior to or during the service period specified in a Booking, we will refund fees in accordance with the cancellation policy selected by the Service Provider on the Petzapp Service.</p>

              <p>In such cases Petzapp may, in its reasonable discretion, issue refunds under terms that vary from a Service Provider’s selected cancellation policy.</p>

              <li><b>Refunds for Substandard Services:-</b></li>
              <p>If we determine in our reasonable discretion that a Service Provider has failed to provide Pet Care Services as agreed with the Pet Owner or otherwise in accordance with these Terms then we may, in our reasonable discretion, cancel a Booking and/or issue a full or partial refund to a Pet Owner.</p>

              <li><b>General Terms for Cancellations:-</b></li>
              <p>If you wish to cancel a Booking, you should use the mechanisms available through the Petzapp Service to do so or email us at <a href="support@petzapp.in" target="blank">support@petzapp.in </a>. </p>

              <p> If you are a Service Provider, Petzapp reserves the right to issue a hold on amounts otherwise payable to you. If there is a reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity involving your account(s) or for other similarly compelling reasons involving protection of Petzapp, the Petzapp community or third party rights.</p>

            <li>Guidelines for Service Providers</li>

            <p>Petzapp is a great way for service providers to reach out to a vast pet lover community. A few things you should keep in mind:-</p>

            <ul style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
              <li>
                <b>Keep your listing updated:- </b>While our team makes every effort to keep information on Petzapp up-to-date, we appreciate you letting us know when an update is required. If your timings change and your listing is not updated, customers arriving late won't be too happy with you (or Petzapp).
              </li>

              <li>
                <b>Don't solicit reviews:- </b>The best way to get reviews is to delight customers with your quality products and service. Selective solicitation is a strict NO, and offering any type of compensation or kick-back for reviews is unfair, so you definitely want to keep away from that, too.
              </li>

              <p>Don’t ever offer freebies, discounts, or payment in exchange for reviews. Don't offer incentives for users to remove reviews. Don’t ask your staff to compete with each other to collect reviews.</p>

              <p>Don’t work with companies or third-party vendors/PR agencies offering to 'fix your reviews/ratings.</p>

              <p>The businesses that do best on Petzapp are the ones that provide a great customer experience to everyone who walks in the door without any expectation or encouragement that they write a positive review.</p>

              <p>If we do come across any evidence (direct/indirect) of you indulging in the solicitation, we will activate a disclaimer on your page, informing the Petzapp community that your reviews are suspicious.</p>

              <li><b>Respond to Criticism Positively:-</b>This happens to all service providers who have customers. These customers are always right, even when they are wrong. Take the unflattering reviews as constructive feedback and use it as an opportunity to fix things. <br><br>

              Whether you agree with the feedback or not, take the criticism in good stride. You can reply with a management response to show you care, but please don't use this as a platform to hit back or offer the customer an incentive to edit their review. Your response can't be edited after posting, so choose your words well.</li>

              <li><b>Be accountable:-</b>Petzapp will not moderate any questionable activities about your Service provider posted in reviews. Petzapp may also not moderate or delete any reviews where any third party service provider is involved. <br><br>

                Such a review may be retained if it falls within our guidelines. This business requires thick skin – stating the perceived attitude of owners or employees and reporting of individual actions are not considered personal attacks.
              </li>

              <li><b>Don't entertain:-</b>Fulfilling the demands of customers who ask for benefits at the threat of bad reviews or ratings, sends a message that this behaviour is tolerated. Similarly, inviting users who have reviewed and given a low rating back to the Service provider for complimentary service, invites false negative reviews.<br><br>

                These issues affect the entire community and require everyone's participation to curb their prevalence. Please report users who engage in such activities to <a href="support@petzapp.in" target="blank">support@petzapp.in</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a concerted effort to maintain the neutrality of content on Petzapp, Service provider owners, employees, and any affiliates with business interests are no longer permitted to write reviews on Petzapp. This is a step towards maintaining neutrality - and quality - of the content on Petzapp.</p>
